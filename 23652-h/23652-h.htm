Near the Sign of the Bell<br />
Liv'd Jobson and Nell<br />
And cobbling of Shoes was his trade<br />
They agreed very well<br />
The neighbors did tell<br />
For he was a funny old blade.<br /><br />
</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/illus_2.jpg" width="700" height="590" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<div class = "maintext"><p>
But Jobson loved whiskey<br />
Which made him so friskey<br />
His noddle when once it got in<br />
That frolick he must<br />
And kick up a dust<br />
For his customers cared not a pin.<br />
</p></div>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/illus_3.jpg" width="700" height="577" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<div class = "maintext">
<p>
The Parson did send<br />
His Shoes for to mend<br />
To take him on Sunday to Church<br />
But Jobson he swore<br />
He would cobble no more<br />
Tho' the people where left in the lurch.<br />
</p></div>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/illus_4.jpg" width="700" height="577" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<div class = "maintext"><p>
Poor Nell then began<br />
To persuade her good man<br />
The soles for to cobble once more<br />
Quoth Jobson you elf<br />
He may do them himself<br />
For many he's cobbled before.<br />
</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/illus_5.jpg" width="700" height="580" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<div class = "maintext"><p>
Now Sunday is come<br />
And the Shoes are not done<br />
Nell called Jobson a very great Sinner<br />
By his fine frisking Airs<br />
The folks got no Prayers<br />
And poor Nell and he got no Dinner.<br />
</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/illus_6.jpg" width="700" height="565" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<div class = "maintext"><p>
But the Parson good man<br />
It was always his plan<br />
To have on a sunday good cheer<br />
Both roast Beef and pudding<br />
With every thing good in<br />
Besides some October strong Beer.<br />
</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/illus_7.jpg" width="700" height="594" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<div class = "maintext"><p>
Then out Jobson set<br />
In a deuce of a pet<br />
For he liked not to fast in the least<br />
And the Parson and he<br />
On this point did agree<br />
They were far better pleas'd at a feast.<br />
</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/illus_8.jpg" width="700" height="585" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<div class = "maintext"><p>
To the Parson's he goes<br />
For Jobson's good Nose<br />
Was led by the savory smell<br />
He caught up the roast<br />
Tho 'tis nothing to boast<br />
And carried it safe home to Nell.<br />
</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/illus_9.jpg" width="700" height="575" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<div class = "maintext"><p>
When the Parson's old Cook<br />
For the Meat came to look<br />
She vow'd 'twas a shocking disaster<br />
And thought this bad news<br />
Would vex more than the Shoes<br />
So in tears ran to tell her old Master.<br />
</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/illus_10.jpg" width="700" height="588" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<div class = "maintext"><p>
The Parson he griev'd<br />
As it may be believ'd<br />
When he heard of the loss of his Beef<br />
His haste was so great<br />
He forgot his bald Pate<br />
And ran out in pursuit of the Thief.<br />
</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/illus_11.jpg" width="700" height="583" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<div class = "maintext"><p>
The Parson he call'd<br />
And the Parson he bawl'd<br />
That running so fast shook his Belly<br />
When he reached Jobson's House<br />
He was mute as a Mouse<br />
He was very near turned to a Jelly.<br />
</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/illus_12.jpg" width="700" height="575" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<div class = "maintext"><p>
When he found his roast Beef<br />
It gave him relief<br />
To think he his meal should not lose<br />
Down together they sat<br />
And eat both lean and fat<br />
And forgave Jobson keeping the Shoes.<br />
